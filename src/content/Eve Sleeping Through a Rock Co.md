# Memory: Eve Sleeping Through a Rock Concert

## The Concert Experience
- The event took place when Eve was about 13 or 14 years old, making it a notable throwback.
- Was a *concert on a school night*, which added to the feeling of being a "bad" parent, but also made the night special.
- Both girls (Eve and her sister) were present and overall seemed to have fun at the show.
- The group sat only 15 feet away from the stage, giving them a prime spot for the show.

## Eve's Memorable Moment
- [[Eve]] was so tired that she ended up **leaning against the wall and falling asleep on the floor**—even with the loud rock music happening right there.
- Despite being in the thick of the action at a *rock concert*, Eve was able to take a nap, which struck Keith as hilarious and memorable.
- This moment has become a fond story and a symbol of Eve's ability to sleep anywhere, as well as a lighthearted family memory.

## Reflections and Feelings
- Keith remembers enjoying the night with both daughters, despite Eve’s unexpected nap.
- The event is recalled with humor and fondness rather than embarrassment or regret.
- Highlights the bond and the fun shared as a family during unique experiences.
