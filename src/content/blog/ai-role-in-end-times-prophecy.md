## Introduction

Lately, I've found my thoughts dwelling on the intersection of two worlds that seem light-years apart: the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the ancient words of end-times prophecy. It's a topic that can feel like science fiction, but the more I look, the more I see patterns that are hard to ignore. This isn't about predicting the future, but about understanding the present by examining it through a unique and thought-provoking lens.

## The Research

When you start looking into the connection between AI and end-times prophecy, you find a surprisingly deep and complex conversation happening. It’s not just one single idea, but a mix of theology, technology, and philosophy.

The most common starting point for many religious commentators is a 2,500-year-old prophecy from the book of Daniel, which says that in the last days, "knowledge shall increase" [1]. For many, the explosive growth of AI and what it can do is a clear sign of this prophecy coming true. Some interpretations go even further, connecting AI to the prophecies in the Book of Revelation. They suggest that AI could be the technology used to create the "Beast," a future global system of economic and social control [2]. This connects to modern ideas like transhumanism—the movement to merge humans with machines. Some theologians see this as a modern-day Tower of Babel, an attempt by humanity to use technology to become god-like [3].

What makes these ancient prophecies feel so relevant today is that the technology for this level of control is no longer science fiction. AI-powered mass surveillance is already being used around the world. Systems that use facial recognition, track our online behavior, and even predict our actions are becoming more common [4]. This raises huge questions about privacy and freedom, showing that the *capability* for a single system to monitor and control society is rapidly developing.

Interestingly, this has led to two different kinds of "end of the world" scenarios being discussed today. There is the religious one, based on prophecy, and a new secular one, based on technology. The secular fear, often called "AI existential risk," is that humans might create a superintelligent AI that we can't control, which could destroy us by accident [5]. While the source of the threat is different (God's plan vs. a human invention), both stories overlap on one key theme: the potential for a single, powerful intelligence to take global control.

However, it's important to note that not all theological views on AI are about doom and gloom. A very common perspective is that AI is simply a powerful tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for evil. While it has the potential for deception and control, it also has the potential to solve diseases, end poverty, and help spread positive messages globally [6]. From this viewpoint, the real challenge isn't the technology itself, but the human hearts and minds that wield it.

## The Sterling Perspective

So, where does this leave us? Talking about biblical prophecy and AI can feel like stepping into a science fiction movie, but the research shows this conversation is happening right now, and for good reason.

The common **perception** is to react in one of two ways. The first is to immediately dismiss any connection as fantasy or conspiracy. The second is to jump to a fearful conclusion, declaring that AI is definitively the "Beast" and the end is tomorrow. Both reactions, in their own way, are simple and shut down the opportunity for deeper thought.

But the **perspective** I’m arriving at is less about finding a definitive answer and more about recognizing a powerful and undeniable pattern. Whether AI is the literal fulfillment of ancient prophecies is not the most interesting question to me. The fact that its development so closely *rhymes* with the themes of those prophecies is what should make us all pause and think.

Consider the ancient themes: a rapid explosion of knowledge, the centralization of global power, the ability to monitor all buying and selling, a figure who can perform "great signs and wonders" to deceive people, and a human desire to become "like God."

Now consider the modern realities of AI: exponential knowledge growth, the technological framework for mass surveillance, social credit systems, realistic deepfakes, and the goals of transhumanism.

The parallels are striking. For me, this isn't a reason to fear technology, but a reason to be incredibly intentional. It's a call to double-down on discernment. In an age where powerful tools can create convincing deceptions, we have to be more rooted than ever in what is true and what is good. It's a reminder to think critically, to question narratives, and to build our foundation on something more solid than the shifting sands of technology.
