## Introduction

The GMI framework suggests the economic 'dominoes' are in motion, signaling a complex but potentially pivotal period ahead. By analyzing the sequence of leading, coincident, and lagging indicators, we can get a clearer picture of where we are and where we might be going.

## Leading Indicators: Fragile Signs of a Bottom

The earliest signals of a potential bottoming in the business cycle are beginning to flash, albeit fragilely. While GMI Financial Conditions remain tight, Global Liquidity is stabilizing, and the Chinese Credit Impulse has turned marginally positive.

Crucially, forward-looking indicators are showing improvement (becoming less negative):
*   **ISM New Orders less Inventories:** This suggests the deep contraction in the ISM business cycle (currently at 46.2) may find a floor as inventory liquidation progresses.
*   **US Railcar Loadings:** An increase here points to a potential firming up of new orders.

These signals collectively suggest a potential rebound in the next 6-12 months. The moderating Dollar also reflects potential market expectations of Fed easing or a slight improvement in global risk appetite.

## Coincident Indicators: A Recessionary Reality

Currently, the indicators that reflect the present moment confirm a recessionary environment. The ISM is firmly in contraction, and cyclical labor remains weak. However, forward-looking markets, like the S&P 500 and commodities, are already attempting to price in a future recovery, showing positive momentum and stabilizing prices.

More importantly for the lagging indicators, **ISM Prices Paid** is falling further, indicating significant disinflationary pressures are building at the upstream level.

## Lagging Indicators: Pain and Disinflationary Relief

Looking ahead, the lagging indicators will continue to reflect the pain of the current contraction, but with significant disinflationary relief.

*   **Unemployment:** We should expect the unemployment rate to continue its upward trend in the coming months, reflecting the delayed impact of the economic slowdown.
*   **Inflation:** The picture here is clear. Current weakness in ISM Prices Paid, along with observed moderation in Core Inflation and the persistent decline in Shelter Inflation (which has a very long lag), strongly signals that both headline and core inflation will continue their downward trajectory. This will provide a substantial disinflationary impulse throughout the economy in the coming months.

## Asset Allocation in a Transitional Phase

This complex economic picture, with conflicting signals from different indicator types, creates a unique environment for asset allocation.

*   **Potential Buying Opportunities (Risk-On):** The forward-looking indicators suggest that assets which have been beaten down may be approaching a buying opportunity. With markets attempting to price in a recovery 6-12 months out, this could be a window to begin accumulating positions in **equities (like the S&P 500)** and **commodities**, which tend to perform well in the early stages of a new business cycle.

*   **The Fixed Income Play:** The clearest signal is the strong disinflationary wave. The expectation that inflation will continue to fall and that the Fed will eventually be forced to ease policy is highly bullish for **bonds**. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise, suggesting a significant opportunity in fixed income.

*   **Potential Profit-Taking:** Conversely, assets that have benefited from the high-rate, high-inflation environment may be approaching a time for profit-taking. The high yields on **cash** and short-term money market funds will likely diminish as the Fed begins to ease, suggesting it may be time to deploy that cash into other assets.

## The Sterling Perspective

**Perception:** The common perception, driven by headlines about unemployment and contraction, is that the economy is in a clear and worsening downturn with no end in sight. The focus is on the pain being felt right now, leading to a flight to the perceived safety of cash.

**Perspective:** The perspective offered by this framework is more nuanced. While the present is indeed recessionary (coincident indicators) and the near future will still see pain (lagging indicators), the *leading* indicators are telling a different story. They suggest it's time to start looking past the current storm towards the recovery on the horizon. The real story is the significant disinflationary wave that is building. This not only creates a prime opportunity in bonds but also gives central banks the room to ease, which will ultimately support the risk-on assets (equities and commodities) that are just beginning to show signs of life.
