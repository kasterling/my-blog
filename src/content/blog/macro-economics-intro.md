# Macro Economics

My journey into the world of Macroeconomics begins with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, namely the very first need at the bottom of the chart: Physiological Needs. Of course, we are all faced with this need first, but having the role of a husband, father, and provider tends to light a fire under your butt. Sometime in the early 2000s, in my continual effort to bolster the bottom line, I came across Forex trading. I had gained enough information about Forex to put it on my radar but never pulled the trigger due to the competition of meeting all the other needs in Maslow's Hierarchy.

Later on in life (circa 2015), I read the book 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' by Robert Kiyosaki and simultaneously stumbled upon a YouTube channel titled 'No Nonsense Forex' that would bring Forex trading back into focus. For those of you who don't already know, Forex is the market of world currencies like the US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, or the Russian Ruble.

None of these currencies have the same value, and the values of all of them are changing by the minute. Why is that? Well... Welcome to the rabbit hole. This is the year 2025, and that is one of many questions that I've been exploring for the last ten years.

The Forex market is the expression of the whole world meeting the very first of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (Physiological Needs).
