# Perfection, Perception, and a Hawaiian Sunset: A Perspective on Finding the Good

We go into certain experiences with a script. A vacation, especially one to a place like Hawaii, comes with a heavy weight of expectation. We have a perception of what it *should* be: perfect sunsets, seamless travel, and a highlight reel of flawless moments. We're chasing a preconceived notion of perfection.

But reality is never that clean. Life, even in paradise, is a mix of the sublime and the frustrating. My recent trip to Kona was a perfect real-world laboratory for this idea. It started with travel delays and included everything from humorous Uber mishaps to a highly anticipated volcano visit that turned out to be a complete letdown. It's incredibly easy to let those negative moments define the narrative. Why is that?

## The Exploration: Overcoming the Negativity Bias

There's a well-documented psychological principle called the **negativity bias**. Our brains are simply wired to pay more attention to negative experiences than positive ones. It's an old survival mechanism. Our ancestors had to be acutely aware of threats. The problem is, in modern life, this bias can cause us to overlook the vast amount of good that is happening all around us, simply because it isn't as loud or demanding as the bad.

On the trip, the 'bad' was certainly present. There was the comical absurdity of a 6 foot man trapped in the back of a tiny Uber, or the genuine disappointment of driving for hours to see an active volcano that was completely docile. If I had let the negativity bias take the wheel, my memory of the trip would be a story of minor failures.

But I'm learning that perspective isn't about what happens to you; it's about what you choose to focus on. And in the midst of the frustrations, there was an overwhelming amount of 'good.' There was the simple, unplanned joy of a morning by the pool. The quiet awe of standing before an old Catholic church. The shared laughter over sunset beers with friends. The easy breeze on a rented bike. These moments weren't on any itinerary. They didn't have the weight of expectation, and because of that, their goodness felt more authentic.

## The Sterling Perspective

My initial perception of the trip was a checklist of experiences I was supposed to have. My worth, or the trip's worth, felt tied to accomplishing this list flawlessly. When things went wrong, it felt like a personal failure. I was letting the negative define the experience because it represented a deviation from the plan.

In writing this, I'm examining how that perspective has shifted. I now believe a good life, much like a good vacation, isn't about achieving a perfect, curated script. It's about acknowledging that the negatives will always be present—they are a part of the texture of reality—but actively and consciously turning your focus to the good that is also, always, present.

The volcano was a bust, but the craft beers and tacos at Lanikai brewery afterward were a moment of genuine connection and enjoyment. The travel was a hassle, but the relief and beauty upon arrival were amplified because of it. The perfection I was seeking wasn't in the flawless execution of a plan, but in the authentic, unplanned moments of beauty and connection that were waiting to be noticed.

## Finding the Good in the Everyday

This isn't just a lesson for travel; it's a framework for daily life. We are constantly surrounded by minor frustrations and major anxieties. The news, our work, our daily commutes—they can all feel like a series of small cuts. The negativity bias can easily take over, painting a picture of a world that is primarily frustrating and bleak.

But the good is also always there. A moment of quiet with a cup of coffee. A genuine smile from a stranger. The satisfaction of a small task completed. These things don't demand our attention like a blaring headline or a stressful email. We have to choose to see them.

This leads me to a question I'm now asking myself: What good is already present in your life today that you might be overlooking while focusing on the inevitable negatives?
