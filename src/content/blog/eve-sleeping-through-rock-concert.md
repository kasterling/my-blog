I thought taking both my girls to see Thousand Foot Crutch [https://youtu.be/Y8s5G0nSvco?si=wcJH7PNiL86EnWXn](https://youtu.be/Vh2YFfeUrOA?si=euAVxcAwVRZSvB_b) would be this perfect shared experience. You know how you get these ideas in your head about how something should go? I had this vision - both daughters enjoying the music with their dad, creating this memory together.

Brenna did exactly what I expected. She was right there with me, into the music, engaged with the whole experience. But Eve... Eve fell asleep. In the middle of a rock concert.

Initially, I'm thinking - okay, maybe she's just tired, or maybe this isn't her thing. But as I'm watching her there, curled up despite the volume, despite the lights, despite everything happening around her, something started clicking for me.

She wasn't there for the band. She was there for me. For us.

I'm realizing this kid was willing to sit through something that clearly wasn't her preference - loud music she didn't choose, staying up later than usual, being in an unfamiliar environment - just because it mattered to me. That's when it hit me: Eve has this incredible drive to connect with people she cares about.

She'll put herself in situations that are new or uncomfortable just so the people around her know they're loved. That sleeping through the concert? That wasn't disinterest. That was her saying, "I'll be here with you even if this isn't my thing, because you matter to me."

And I almost missed it. I almost saw it as her not engaging instead of recognizing it for what it actually was - one of the purest expressions of love I've ever witnessed.

## The Sterling Perspective

When I really think about what happened that night, I'm seeing how wrong I was about what success even looks like.

I went in measuring everything by whether both girls would enjoy the music the same way I do. That was my scorecard - shared enthusiasm equals connection. But that's not what Eve was offering me at all.

She was showing me something I didn't even know I was looking for. This willingness to be present for something that isn't "for you" because it matters to someone you love - that's actually a deeper form of connection than I was even aiming for.

I keep thinking about how many times I've probably missed these quiet expressions of care. How often do people stretch themselves to connect with me in ways I don't recognize because I'm looking for the obvious signs?

Eve sleeping through that concert is teaching me that love doesn't always look like matching energy. Sometimes it looks like showing up anyway. Sometimes it looks like finding your own way to be present for experiences that matter to people who matter to you.

I almost completely misread the whole thing. I almost saw indifference where there was actually one of the purest forms of love I've ever witnessed. That makes me wonder - what else am I missing when I assume I know what care looks like?
