# When I Look at My Children's Teaching Careers Through an AI Lens

Both of my daughters chose education. Not the safe, predictable education field I remember from my own schooling—they're entering a profession that's being fundamentally reshaped by artificial intelligence. As I watch them build their careers, I'm caught between wanting to prepare them for what's coming and respecting their autonomy to navigate their own professional paths.

The tension is real: How do you support adult children facing career uncertainty without becoming the overprotective parent who undermines their confidence?

## The Assumption I'm Questioning

The conventional wisdom says parents should either "let kids figure it out themselves" or "guide them based on your experience." But what happens when your experience becomes irrelevant? When the career landscape changes so rapidly that parental guidance might actually be counterproductive?

I'm questioning whether traditional parenting approaches work when your children face unprecedented professional challenges that you've never experienced.

## What the Research Shows

The data on AI's impact on education is sobering and hopeful simultaneously. According to recent analysis, while AI threatens to automate 20-40% of traditional education tasks, it's simultaneously creating 170 million new jobs globally by 2030.

**The immediate reality:** 60% of teachers already use AI tools, saving up to 13 hours weekly. The AI education market has exploded to $5.88 billion with 38% annual growth. Meanwhile, 142,000+ AI-related education jobs are posted on LinkedIn, commanding salary premiums up to 43% for professionals with multiple AI skills.

**The risk profile:** Administrative roles face immediate displacement—graders, teaching assistants, and basic tutors could see 30-70% job reductions within 2-5 years. Even instructional designers, a role that seemed future-proof, now face AI systems that can generate courses automatically.

**The opportunity landscape:** AI-enhanced instructional designers earn $75,000-$120,000+. Educational data scientists command $95,000-$220,000+. Learning engineers, a role that barely existed three years ago, now earn $75,000-$160,000+.

The McKinsey Global Institute offers perhaps the most balanced perspective: "Despite dire predictions, teachers are not going away any time soon. In fact, we estimate school teachers will grow by 5 to 24 percent in the United States between 2016 and 2030. Many of the attributes that make good teachers great are the very things that AI or other technology fails to emulate: inspiring students, building positive school climates, resolving conflicts, creating connection and belonging."

## My Experience

Here's what I'm wrestling with: My daughters are smart, capable professionals. They're already adapting to technology in ways I never had to. But as their father, I see the bigger picture of economic disruption that they might not be tracking while they're focused on day-to-day teaching.

When I try to share what I've learned about AI's impact on education, I risk sounding like the parent who thinks his kids can't handle reality. When I stay quiet, I worry I'm failing to use my research and analytical skills to help people I care about most.

The Eve concert moment keeps coming back to me—how I almost missed her quiet way of showing love because I was measuring connection by my own standards. Am I doing the same thing here? Measuring their career preparation by my standards rather than recognizing how they're actually adapting?

## The Sterling Perspective

What I'm realizing is that the goal isn't to make my daughters dependent on my analysis of their career prospects. It's to help them develop their own frameworks for navigating uncertainty while staying connected to them as they do.

The research shows that education professionals who thrive in the AI era will be those who master human-AI collaboration—not those who fight technology or those who become dependent on it, but those who understand how to leverage it while preserving what makes human teaching irreplaceable.

That balance mirrors exactly what I'm trying to achieve as a parent: How do you offer valuable perspective without undermining their confidence to make their own decisions?

The answer isn't choosing between independence and support. It's modeling how to stay curious, how to research thoroughly, and how to adapt continuously—then trusting them to apply those capabilities to their own situations.

Instead of saying "Here's what you need to do about AI," I can share what I'm learning and ask what they're seeing from their frontline perspective. Instead of protecting them from uncomfortable realities, I can help them develop the analytical tools to assess those realities themselves.

The education sector's transformation isn't just about technology—it's about developing the kind of adaptive thinking that will serve them regardless of how their field evolves. And that's something I can model without controlling their choices.

Maybe the best way to foster their autonomy while maintaining our connection isn't to become their career strategist. It's to become their thinking partner when they want one, and their supporter regardless of what they decide.
