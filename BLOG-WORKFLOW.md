# Blog Post Creation Workflow

## Phase 1: Curiosity Capture
1. **Start with a question** that genuinely puzzles you
   - "Why do most parenting experts focus on either independence OR connection?"
   - "What if government gold accounting is deliberately outdated?"
   - "Why did Eve's behavior at the concert surprise me?"

2. **Check PERSPECTIVES.md** for related themes
   - Find existing bullet points that connect
   - Look for research gaps marked "**Research needed**"
   - Identify personal experiences to explore

## Phase 2: Research & Validation
3. **Find 2-3 credible sources** that address your question
   - Academic studies, established research
   - Data that supports or challenges your assumption
   - Expert perspectives that add depth

4. **Document key findings** in a scratch file
   - Quote specific data points
   - Note contradictions or gaps in research
   - Identify what research doesn't address

## Phase 3: Personal Connection
5. **Connect research to your experience**
   - How does the data explain what you've observed?
   - Where does your experience diverge from research?
   - What insights emerge from combining both?

6. **Find the Sterling Perspective angle**
   - What assumption are you challenging?
   - How does this examine "perspectives against perceptions"?
   - What conventional wisdom needs questioning?

## Phase 4: Structure & Write
7. **Create the post structure**
   - Hook: Share the personal moment that sparked curiosity
   - Context: Present the research and data
   - Perspective: Your unique insight combining experience + research
   - Implication: What this means for readers

8. **Write with voice consistency**
   - Lead with genuine curiosity, not conclusions
   - Balance authority (research) with humility (personal experience)
   - Focus on examining rather than preaching
